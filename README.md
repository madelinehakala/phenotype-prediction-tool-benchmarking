# Benchmarking Various Phenotype Prediction Tools

## Overview
This project utilizes an RNA-Seq dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that can be used to train and test models for their ability to predict whether a patient has cancer.
In the bioinformatics field, there are many tools that have been developed specifically for phenotype prediction--in addition to common machine learning models. This project 
seeks to benchmark such tools to determine which tool has the overall best performance when evaluating accuracy/F1 score, memory usage, and run time.
